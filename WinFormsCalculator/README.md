# WinFormsCalculator

An attempt to make a basic calculator with the ability to save the things done until it closes.

Keyboard is supported (unless something breaks then that means I didn't do something right).
You can see the mappings below if you are curious:
- 0 - 9 => Good ol' numbers
- +, -, \*, /, %, = => Speak for themselves I feel
- . => Makes every new number be after the decimal point
- E or e => Is mapped to CE
- C or c => Is mapped to C
- S or s => Is mapped to x²
- R or r => Is mapped to √
- N or n => Is mapped to x⁻¹
- F or f => Is mapped to ±
- H or h => Is mapped to View History
- ESC => Will close either the main calculator window / form or the calculator history one depending on which one is opened
- Backspace => ⌫

(Last one was the most useful I imagine)
