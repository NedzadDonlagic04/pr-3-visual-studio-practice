# BasicMathExpressionParser

As the name says, a console app which can take user input for a math expression and evaluates it.
After a really good code review I have decided to redo the project in it's own solution here:
https://github.com/NedzadDonlagic04/MathParser

To hopefully fix a lot of the issues I had with it here.

Resources I used to figure this out:
